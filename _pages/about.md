## Site Configuration and Features

This website is powered by the **[Academic Pages Template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)**, a free GitHub Pages template designed for academic websites. The site is built using Jekyll, and content is managed through markdown files.

---

Feel free to explore my work and check back for updates!

**Note**: The above content assumes you're using markdown for your pages, as it's common in Jekyll-based templates like **Academic Pages**. You can edit the markdown files for each section (such as publications, talks, etc.) and fill them with your content. Additionally, you can modify the theme and styling to match your personal preferences using CSS.

### 2. **How to Structure and Update the Content in Markdown**

Each section of the website (e.g., Research, Publications, CV) corresponds to a specific markdown file, and each of these files will have metadata (YAML front matter) that describes the content type. Here's a breakdown:

- **Research**: Typically a markdown file under `_research` or `_projects`.
- **Publications**: A markdown file under `_publications` for each publication.
- **Talks**: Similarly, for talks under `_talks`.
- **Blog Posts**: Markdown files under `_posts` if you have blog-style updates.
- **CV**: A downloadable PDF link or another markdown file for CV summary.

Each markdown file should include metadata and structured content. Here's an example of a markdown file for a publication:
